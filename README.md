**Full Title:** Real-Time Big Data Analytics and Visualization for Urban Traffic Flow Optimization

This project uses **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban MObility) to simulate traffic, which is then fed into a genetic algorithm implemented in Python via the **PyGAD** library to optimize traffic light timings across complex intersection networks. 

The goal is to **reduce congestion**, **improve throughput**, and **enable real-time visualization** of evolving traffic patterns.
